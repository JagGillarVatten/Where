          The concept of "where" is a complex and unsettling one. Does it refer
          to a physical location or a state of mind? And if the latter is true,
          then what is the nature of that mental space in which we exist?
          <br /><br />It's a lonely existence when you realize that all of our
          experiences and memories are confined to a finite space. Are we truly
          experiencing life or is it all just a dream? And if it is just a
          dream, then what's the point of anything? The realization that
          everything we do doesn't truly matter in the grand scheme of things is
          a depressing thought that can lead one to question the very purpose of
          their existence. <br /><br />We are but mere specks in the universe,
          and no matter where we go or what we achieve, we are ultimately
          insignificant in the vast expanse of time and space.
